To address this, we started the EvalPlus project -- a rigourous evaluation framework for LLM4Code that:

+ âœ¨ improves programming benchmarks by patching up to thounds of new tests! `EvalPlus(HumanEval) => HumanEval+` (81x new tests!)
+ âœ¨ crafts a set utility tools to sanitize, visualize and inspect LLM-generated code and evaluation results!
+ âœ¨ accelerates LLM4Code research by open-sourcing LLM-generated samples for 10+ models -- no to re-run the expensive benchmarks!

This repo contains the enhanced versions of popular code synthesis evaluation datasets along with tools for you to easily use our enhanced dataset to evaluate LLM generated code and even
create your own enhanced datasets!

## Use EvalPlus-Enhanced Dataset

To get started, please first setup the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evalplus/evalplus.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### HumanEval+

```python
from evalplus.data import get_human_eval_plus

fe = get_human_eval_plus() # -> a list of dictionaries (each is a programming problem)
# "task_id" is the identifier string for the task
# "entry_point": name of the function
# "prompt" is the function signature with docstring
# + "canonical_solution" is the ground-truth implementation (re-implemented to fix bugs in HumanEval)
# + "base_input" is the test inputs in original HumanEval
# + "plus_input" is the test inputs brought by EvalPlus
# and others...
```

### MBPP+ (TBD)


## Useful tools

### Syntax Checker for LLM-generated Code

Check LLM-produced code and answer the following questions:

1. Is the generation entirely done for all samples / all problems in the dataset?
2. Are LLM-generated code compilable? (if no, something could be wrong and you'd better check)

```shell
python tools/checker.py --folder /path/to/[model]-[??]b_temp_[??] --dataset humaneval
```

### Post Code Sanitizer

LLM-generated code may contain some syntax errors.
But some of them can be easily fixable by doing simple post-processing.
This tool will make the LLM-generated code more clean/compilable by doing certain post-processing such as trimming with more magical EOFs and some garbage non-code tokens.

```shell
python tools/sanitize.py --eof --folder /path/to/vicuna-[??]b_temp_[??]
# Sanitized code will be produced to `/path/to/vicuna-[??]b_temp_[??]-sanitized`
```

### Render `pass@k` Results to `rich` and LaTeX Tables

```shell
python tools/render.py --type /path/to/[model]-[??]b # NOTE: no `_temp_[??]`
```

### Perform Test Input Generation from Scratch (TBD)


## Development

Before you start:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
```

### Name Convention

- `evalplus` is the package name.
- `${DATASET}_plus` is the name of dataset applied with `evalplus`.
